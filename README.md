Experienced engineer with a passion for the inner workings of systems. I traverse the whole stack and care about the whole software lifecycle. I believe in developers truly owning the systems they deliver.

Working at [GreenSync](https://github.com/greensync) on [deX](https://dex.energy), the Decentralized Energy Exchange: a platform that enables electricity grids to support more distributed renewable energy resources.

I'm a self-taught developer from a non-technical background. I've been working in tech since 2011.

My name is prounounced with a hard C.

I live in Melbourne, where I cycle a lot, hang out with my amazing partner, cook and read.

I'm a non-binary trans woman. She/her or they/them.
